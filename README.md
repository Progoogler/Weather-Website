# Weather-Website

This is a FreeCodeCamp project that takes us through the process
of retrieving information from a weather API and displaying the
handpicked results in a pretty format.

The conditions of the project expects the temperature to include
a conversion setting between Fahrenheit and Celcius.

Enjoy the nice day!
